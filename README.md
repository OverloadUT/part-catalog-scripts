Personal PartCatalog Scripts
---------------

This is a collection of Lua scripts written by me for auto-configuring [PartCatalog](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35018) with mods I use. Feel free to use them in your own installation, or to modify them under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).

Note: these scripts require [toerti's icon pack](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35018?p=1240571#post1240571). The resource categories for generators and converters might not point to the right icons without it.
